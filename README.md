# Eye Movement

### Description
This exercise uses a simple onmousemove event to track mouse movement and it's position and then calculate the x, y value can be used as inputs for the element's transform property. 

### How to Run
Download all three files: index.html, eyes.css, and styles.css and then open the index.html. 

### Roadmap
Future improvement can include adding a ball that moves randomly on the page and the eyes will follow the ball. 
Once the eyes follow the ball, it no longer follows the mouse.
